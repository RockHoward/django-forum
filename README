This is a revamped version of Ross Poulton's django-form.
I made this repo to experiment with adding django-forum to Pinax.

The changes this far:
    -- move everythng but LICENSE.TXT and README.TXT into
        a new subdir named "forum"

    -- added a setup.py in the main directory

    -- moved "forum/templates/forum_base.html" to
        "forum/templates/forum/base.html" and made the
        other forum templates extend "forum/base.html"
        instead of "forum_base.html"

Still to do:
    -- move the media stuff out of base.html and make forum.css
    -- make the base.html pinax friendly.

Note that besides this file and the setup.py which I added,
every file is really the work of Ross Poulton and the other
contributors to django-forum.

If my experiements work out OK, I will be submitting this stuff
back to Ross's project. After that I plan to delete this repo.
